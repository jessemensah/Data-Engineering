BUILDING A DATAWAREHOUSE IN GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORM FOR USING PUBLIC DATA IN BIGQUERY 

Hello guys, 

In this section, we will be building a data warehouse 

OPEN YOUR BIGQUERY CONSOLE 
-> FROM PUBLIC DATA 
-> SEARCH BASEBALL 
-> VIEW DATASET 
-> SEARCH FOR SCHEDULES TABLE 
CLICK ON THE SCHEDULES TABLE AND YOU GET 
SCHEMA | DETAILS | PREVIEW | LINEAGE | DATAPROFILE | DATA QUALITY 
SCHEMA -> SHOWS ALL THE FIELDS OR COLUMNS AND DATA TYPE INSIDE THE TABLE 
DETAILS -> SHOWS SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE TABLE 
WHEN IT WAS CREATED AND MODFIFIED 
WHERE DATA IS LOCATED 
WHETHER ITS CASE SENSITIVE OR NOT 
WHETHER IT CONTAINS PRIMARY KEYS TO BE JOINED TO OTHER DATA 

STORAGE INFORMATION 
NUMBER OF ROWS IN THE DATA 
TOTAL LOGICAL BYTES ?? 
ACTIVE LOGICAL BYTES ?? 

PREVIEW -> SHOWS FIRST 50 ROWS OF THE DATA 
AS YOU CAN SEE YOU CAN EXPAND TO GET 100 ROWS 

LINEAGE -> SHOWS WHERE THE DATASET CAME FROM 

PROFILE -> IT THIS REQUIRES BILLING ACCOUNT ENABLED 

DATA QUALITY -> ALSO REQUIRES BILLING ACCOUNT ENABLED 


NOW LETS WRITE A SIMPLE SELECT * SCRIPT TO SEE BIGQUERY IN ACTION 
You can pick the table id from the details section 


PART 2 
DATA TYPES IN BIGQUERY 
BIGQUERY HAS A VERY SIMPLE LIST OF DATA TYPES 
STORING TEXT USE STRING 
STORING NUMBERS USE INTEGER 

BIGQUERY ALWAYS WANTS YOU TO STORE TIMESTAMPS USING UTC FORMAT ?? 




DEVELOPING A DATA WAREHOUSE 
1. NEED ACCESS TO CLOUD SHELL 
2. CHECK CREDENTIALS USING GCLOUD INFO 
3. INITIALISE CREDENTIALS USING CLOUD INIT 
4. CODE EXAMPLES AND DATASETS VIA GIT 
5. USING GIT TO UPLOAD DATA TO GOOGLE CLOUD STORAGE 



1. ACCESS TO CLOUD SHELL 
CLOUD SHELL IS JUST LIKE A TERMINAL ON YOUR COMPUTER 
CLICK ON IT ON TOP RIGHT CORNER 

STEP 2 => (gcloud info) inside cloud shell 
this will give us information about install components 
[show the side of it] 

STEP 2 => gcloud init command 
what is gcloud init ??
=> this shows list of configurations that have been created and want to try to create a new one 
=> type command in 
=> you get two options 
=> reinitialise the configuration or create a new configuration 
=> lets create a new configuration 
=> call it jess-confi 
=> choose you email used to sign in to GCP 
=> now for cloud project -> pick 3 to create a new project 
=> enter project name => testingjess-1234
=> wait for everything to finish and there you have it 

NB: YOU CAN CREATE PROJECT VIA CLOUD SHELL OR IN USER INTERFACE HERE 



PART 2 => DOWNLOADING DATA FROM GIT 
1 => CREATE A GOOGLE CLOUD STORAGE BUCKET 
2 => ENTER THE BUCKET INFORMATION 
3 => UPLOAD A LOCAL FILE TO GCS BUCKET USING gsutil 


CREATING A BUCKET 
1. ADD A UNIQUE PROJECT NAME ie test-jess-data-bucket
CHOOSE STORAGE CLASS FOR YOUR DATA ?? WHAT ARE THE STORAGE CLASSES ?? 
STANDARD 
NEARLINE 
COLDLINE 
ARCHIVE 

CHOOSE HOW TO CONTROL ACCESS TO OBJECTS ?? 
UNIFORM ?? 
FINE GRAINED ?? 

CHOOSE HOW TO PROTECT OBJECT DATA ?? 
NONE ?? 
OBJECT VERSIONING ?? (FOR DATA RECOVERY) 
RENTENTION POLICY ?? (FOR COMPLIANCE) 


2. BACK TO CLOUD SHELL
RUN FILE sh upload_local_files_gcs.sh 

3. CLONE PROJECT FROM GITHUB 
4. UPLOAD FILE TO GCS BUCKET VIA GSUTIL
