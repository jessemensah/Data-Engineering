This is the second video for modelling part 2

In this final video on data modelling we will be going through 
1. Cross Filter options when choosing a cardinality type 
2. Some practical examples of data modelling 
We will look at 
1. Football 
2. Hotel booking system(AIRBNB OR HOTEL)



Lets begin with Cross Filter options 
1. One to Many or Many to one relationship 
In the last video we said this is when one row in the first table is related to many rows in the second table. 
Now the cross filter direction can be Single or Both here 
let us consider both tables below 

Provide a screen shot or design of a two tables for one to many relationship with cross filter direction of both or single. 

2. One to one relationship 
this happens in a scenario when you have unique values in both tables per column.
Now the filter direction can be single or both 
Provide an image or design of two tables for one to one relationship 


3. Many to Many relationship 
This happens when many rows in the first table is related to many rows in the second table. 
Provide an image or design of the two tables for the many to many relationship 



Real world examples 

1. Lets take a couple of football legends 
1. Drogba 
2. Lampard 
3. Kolo Toure 
4. Yaya toure 

These three players have played for more than two teams 
Let us list some teams including the teams they have played for 
Teams 
1. Liverpool 
2. Aston Villa 
3. Chelsea 
4. Westham 
5. Barcelona 
6. Real Madrid 
7. Mancity 
8. Marseille 


What will be the best modelling scenario for this ?? 
Create a player Table 
Create a Team table 
Then create a bridge table between  players and teams 
This table contains Player ID AND Team ID 
Now populate this table with the player team combinations 

Then we create a many to many relationship between Player and Team table via the bridge table 


2. Hotel Booking system 
a blog by https://medium.com/towards-data-engineering/data-modelling-design-a-data-model-for-a-hotel-booking-system-like-airbnb-2110a6d079c6
lays it well but in summary 
Using STAR SCHEMA to model this will be 

Hotel Dimension 
1.Hotel ID
2.Title
3.Location
4.Type

Guest Dimension 
1.Guest ID
2.Name
3.Email
4.Phone Number

Booking Dimension 
1.Booking ID
2.User ID
3.Property ID
4.Check-in Date
5.Check-out Date
6.Number of Guests

Payment Dimension 
1. Payment ID
2. Booking ID
3. Payment Date
4. Amount

Review Dimension 
1. Review ID
2. User ID
3. Property ID
4. Rating


Fact Tables will be 
User Fact Table 
- Number of Bookings made by the Guest
- Total amount spent by the User on Bookings
Hotel Fact Table 
- Number of Bookings made for the Property
- Total amount earned from Bookings for the Property
- The average rating for the Property
3. Booking Fact 
- The total price of the Booking
- Number of Nights booked
- Booking Status

4. Payment Fact 
- Amount of payment made for the Booking
- Payment Status

5. Review Fact 
- Rating given in the review

There is not a one size fit all for star schema 
before you begin modelling you need to study the data 
and define the question you want the data to answer before 
you begin modelling.
