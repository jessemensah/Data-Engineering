NUMPY 
Hello guys welcome to Computing with Numpy 

In this 20 minute video 
we will be diving into Numpy, 
a very important library that has revolutionised numerical computing. 
This library has incredible features that is crucial for anyone working with Data in Python. 

Numpy is short for numerical python, which is a library that provides support for 
large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with an extensive collection 
of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. 
It was created to address the limitations of Python when it came to handling numerical operations efficiently.

The importance of numpy should be highlighted 
1. Efficient Array Operations, 
Array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements that are identified as an index. 
Arrays are used to hold and organise data in a way that makes it easy to access, modify and manipulate 
individual elements or groups of elements. 
Numpy core feature is its ability to handle arrays efficiently. 
2. Math functions 
Numpy has an extensive library of math functions. which makes it easy to 
perform complex calculations like linear algebra. 
3. Integration with other libraries 
Numpy integrates with other popular libraries like Scipy, Matplotlib etc which makes it possible to create 
data centric tasks.

Numpy has influence in the world cannot be measured 
It is used widely in 
1. Data Analysis, Data Science and Machine Learning 
Numpy sits at the core of many analytical workflows 
2. Scientific Research 
3. Financial Analysis
